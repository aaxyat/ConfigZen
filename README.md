## ⚙️ Scripts ⚙️

### `Windows Terminal Hotkey Automation (AHK)`

This script contains two AutoHotkey functions, `SwitchToWindowsTerminal` and `SwitchToWindowsTerminalAdmin`. The functions check if Windows Terminal is already open and if so, they minimize or put it in focus depending on the current state of the window. If Windows Terminal is not open, they launch it. Hotkeys have also been set up to activate these functions.

### `winSetup.ps1 (PowerShell)`

This PowerShell script automates the installation and setup of several tools and packages for a Windows environment, including PowerShell 7, StartAllBack, and many others installed via Chocolatey. The script also installs a set of PowerShell 7 modules, modifies the PowerShell 7 execution policy, and sets up a PowerShell 7 profile from a provided gist. The script also sets up the Windows Terminal and Starship settings from provided gists. Finally, it compiles an AutoHotkey script and sets it up to run on startup.
